# liri-node-app
This is a javascript app which uses nodeJs. It retrieves information from 3 different APIs.  The command-line names include the following: "my-tweets" which will show your last 20 tweets from your twitter account and when they were created. The command "spotify-this-song" accesses the spotify API for the artist, song name, preview link, and album, of the song title entered. If no song is provided it will default to the song "The Sign" by Ace of Base. The command "movie-this" will output the title, year, IMDB rating, country, language, plot, actors, rotton tomatoes rating, and its' rotton tomatoes url. If no movie is provided then it defualts to "Mr. Nobody." The "do-what-it-says" command will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands
