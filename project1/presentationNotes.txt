CORS **** is very important.

Headers can be added to ajax call, to enable communication with API. CORS (cross origin.....)

work on feature branches. initiate pull req. goes thru code review. then push to master branch.

will use GitHub issues. can track bugs. 
write issues for each of your features.

master branch is only the code we want in production. 
don't keep checking stuff into the master branch if its not tested or whole. 

WE are FOLLOWING GITHUB FLOW, (not git flow!!!!)
this is paradigm we will follow.

everytime we are working on new feature, make a new branch.

git checkout of SOME NEW BRANCH NAME to create a new branch.
code locally on branch. can push the branches up to git hub.

When you think code is ready...initiate PULL request.
Then code review will start. Group might have changes they request to make.
Once it passes review, you can merge into master....until that time the CODE is not live and NOT in production.

Research GITHUB FLOW to find info
