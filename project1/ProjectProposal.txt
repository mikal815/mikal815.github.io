Project Description
    Compare 2 different Bitcoin exchanges to see who has the best rates.
    CBOE and CME Groups are Bitcoin exchanges with their own APIs.
    We will pull data from these 2 APIs to allow users to compare their rates.
    
    User can request data for current price, 1 month, 2 months, and volume.

    User can look at volume of sales. 
    
    Ratio is one to 5...CBOE to CME
    

WHy this data is important and useful:
        This project focuses on trading futures markets.
        Futures offer a fast, cost-effective way to trade financial and commodity markets. 

        They are standardized contracts to buy or sell a particular asset at a set price,
        on a set date in the future, 
        in predefined quantity and quality. Traders worldwide use futures to easily 
        reduce risk or seek profits on changing markets.
